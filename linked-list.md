## Sort List

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/

```python
def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    head = ListNode(0)
    pointer = head
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            pointer.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            pointer.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        pointer = pointer.next
    if not l1:
        pointer.next = l2
    elif not l2:
        pointer.next = l1
    return head.next


def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    firstPoint = head
    secondPoint = head
    while secondPoint.next and secondPoint.next.next:
        firstPoint = firstPoint.next
        secondPoint = secondPoint.next.next
    return firstPoint


def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    middle = self.middleNode(head)
    rightList = self.sortList(middle.next)
    middle.next = None
    leftList = self.sortList(head)
    return self.mergeTwoLists(leftList, rightList)
